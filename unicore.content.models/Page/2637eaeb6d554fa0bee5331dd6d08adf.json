  "content": "There is a good chance that malaria is somewhere near you, as 1 in 7 people worldwide carry the disease. But before we can fight malaria, we need to understand it.\r\n\r\n**Malaria is a parasite**\r\n\r\nMalaria is caused by a parasite \u2013 a living thing that uses other living things, like your body, for food and a place to live. To beat the disease, we need to kill the parasite inside the human body through active testing and treatment.\r\n\r\n**You get it from mosquitoes**\r\n\r\nAnopheles mosquitoes are a type of mosquito that transmits malaria. They mostly bite at night, between the hours of 9pm and 5am. That is why it is important to sleep under a bed net and every night. \r\n\r\n**It is most dangerous to pregnant women and children**\r\n\r\nMalaria can infect everyone, but it is especially important to protect pregnant women and children, who are more likely to die from the disease. Over 200,000 newborn babies die a year because of malaria during pregnancy.\r\n\r\n**What are the symptoms?**\r\n\r\nEarly symptoms may be felt as early as one week after infection, or as late as one month. These include chills, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\r\n\r\nIf left untreated, severe symptoms, such as coma and death can occur.\r\n\r\n***If you have any of these symptoms, visit a clinic immediately!***\r\n\r\n**Malaria matters**\r\n\r\nMalaria can affect the lives of people around you and destroy your country\u2019s economy. Learn more about why malaria matters. \r\n",
